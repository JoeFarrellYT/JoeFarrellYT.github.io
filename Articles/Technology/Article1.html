	<h2>Why Elon Musk will advance humanity beyond our imaginations</h2>
	<div class = "responsive">
		<p>Elon Musk is an impressive individual =, programming his first game "Blastar" at the age of 12 (which in 1984 is even more remarkable), and selling t for $500. In 1995 Elon had a business idea which would change his future forever, with his brother, he brought this idea to life and created Zip2 (a company that provided and licensed online city guide software to newspapers), they did this whilst sleeping on his office couch and showering at the YMCA, eventually selling it for $307 million. Following this he made and sold X.com for $1.5 billion, now known as PayPal. Giving him the resources to change the world forever...</p>
		<img src="blastar.PNG" alt = "Blastar Image" style = "width:40%;height:auto;min-width: 250px;">
		<p>Elon the founded SpaceX and co-founded Tesla. Working 120 hour weeks, he was now sleeping on the Tesla factory floor due to his companies struggling to "take off", Elon is committed to making space travel reusable and accessible, after all, along with space travel comes infinite resources, energy and space, as well as a backup to Earth. He added the car industry by filling it with 'SEXY' electric cars to help our own planet out. Advancing battery teschnology and autopilot whilst he's at it.</p>
		<p>Despite the media's constant hammering of Musk, it has driven and motivated him to new heights, resulting in Tesla and SpaceX becoming 2 extremely successful companies. So Elon being Elon created half a dozen more. SolarCity which is now one of the biggest solar panel companies. The Boring Company and HyperLoop to revolutionize travel by eliminating traffic and making travel quick. Starlink for speedy internet wherever you are in the world.</p>
		<p>But perhaps the crazuest of them all is OpenAi and NeuraLink. NeuraLink will be capable to solve any motor problem, had a stroke where you can't move one side of your body? No problem. Communication could happen from brain to brain, no need for talking!you can have access to all knowledge you desire thanks to his Starlink creation.</p>
		<p>OpenAI is creating general artificial intelligence which would cause an intelligence explosion. You want to know the cure for cancer? Easy-peasy. General AI could figure that out within an hour. Elon is surpisingly against the development of general Ai as it could go wrong, others aren't creating it without the right precautions so he wants to be first to create a safe version.</p>
		<p>People may not like or respect Elon, but one day, even the most hateful of haters will have to eat their words and accept he's the most influential person on Earth.</p>
